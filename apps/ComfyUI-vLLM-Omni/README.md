# vLLM-Omni

vLLM-Omni offers a ComfyUI integration on top of its online serving API.
It can send model inference requests to either a locally running vLLM-Omni service or a remote one.

## Requirement

- Python 3.12 or above
- [ComfyUI installed](https://docs.comfy.org/installation/system_requirements)
- [vLLM-Omni installed](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/vllm-omni/en/latest/getting_started/installation/) on either the same device or another device discoverable via the internet.
- No need to install additional packages apart from those already required by ComfyUI.

> [!TIP]
> If you run both ComfyUI and vLLM-Omni on the same device, you can create separate virtual environments and use different Python versions for them.


## Installation

Copy this folder to the `custom_nodes` subfolder of your ComfyUI installation. Your directory should look like `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-vLLM-Omni`.

If you are running ComfyUI during copying, you should restart ComfyUI to load this extension.

> [!TIP]
> You can use utility websites such as https://download-directory.github.io/ to download a subdirectory of a repo. Also checkout community discussions (e.g., https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repository) for more info.

On the device and virtual environment you run ComfyUI, launch ComfyUI with
```bash
cd ComfyUI

# The regular way
python main.py

# If you are mainly using this node, launch it faster with
python main.py --cpu
```

On the device and virtual environment you run vLLM-Omni, start a model service with
```bash
vllm serve The_Model_ID_to_Serve --omni --port 8000
```

Check **ComfyUI's sidebar -> Node Library**. There should be a new folder named **vLLM-Omni**.
If no, check your shell running the ComfyUI process. There may be some error messages before the line `Import times for custom nodes:` and the line `To see the GUI go to: http://127.0.0.1:8188`.

## Quickstart

This extension offers the following nodes based on the output modalities (at **ComfyUI sidebar -> Node Library**):

- **Generate Image** for text-to-image and image-to-image tasks
- **Multimodality Comprehension** for multimodality-to-text and multimodality-to-audio tasks
- **TTS** and **TTS Voice Clone** for TTS tasks

This extension also offers example workflows (at **ComfyUI sidebar -> Templates -> vLLM-Omni**)

> [!INFO]
> The node UI and feature designs are intended to match vLLM-Omni online serving interfaces. It cannot offer more than what the interfaces support.

To build a simple workflow yourself,

- Drag a generation node onto the canvas.
- Depending on your need, grab built-in multimedia file loader nodes, such as **image->Load Image**, **image->video->Load Video**, **audio->Load Audio**
- Depending on your need, grab built-in multimedia file preview nodes, such as **image->Preview Image**, **image->video->Save Video**, **audio->Preview Audio**. For text output, you can install [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts plugin](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts/) and grab its **utils->Show Text 🐍** node.
- If you want to tune sampling parameters, grab corresponding nodes from **vLLM-Omni-> Sampling Params**.
    - For multi-stage models, you can connect multiple **AR Sampling Params** and **Diffusion Sampling Params** nodes to a **Multi-Stage Sampling Params List** node, and connect this node to the generation node.
    - For some multi-stage models like BAGEL, [only one stage's sampling parameters are exposed and tunable via vLLM-Omni's online serving API](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/vllm-omni/en/latest/user_guide/examples/online_serving/bagel/). Thus, these models are treated as single-stage ones. Please check the vLLM-Omni documentation on how to correctly set each model's sampling parameters.
    - For multi-stage models where all stages are either autoregression or diffusion, you can also connect only a single Sampling Params node, indicating that this set of sampling parameters will be used for all stages.

**The following features are tested**:

- Single-node workflows for
    - Multimodal Comprehension (e.g., Qwen Omni, BAGEL)
    - Text-to-Image Generation (e.g., Qwen-Image)
    - Image-to-Image Generation (e.g., Qwen-Image-Edit)
    - TTS (e.g., Qwen TTS, including VoiceDesign, VoiceClone, CustomVoice)

**The following features are not currently tested**. They may work or break. You are welcomed to test it out and offer comments.

- Multi-node workflow that connects multiple model services together.

> [!TIP]
> Although this node enables all-modality input, you should check whether the specific model you host and request for supports the modalities you connect to the node.

You can configure per-stage sampling parameters for multi-stage models.

> [!TIP]
> The node automatically choose text-to-image or image-to-image API endpoints depending on whether you connect an image input or not.

> [!TIP]
> There is a dedicated node for VoiceClone tasks with reference audio input. Other simple text-to-speech tasks should use the regular TTS node.

## Develop

Follow the [development convention and rules of vLLM-Omni](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/vllm-omni/en/latest/contributing/).

## Limitation and Non-Goals

- Single server mode only. No automatic load balancing or failover.
- Features set is bounded to vLLM-Omni's online service capability, including
    - The types of models supported in online mode,
    - The types of sampling parameters supported in the online mode,
    - The ways to send files (primarily through full-length base64 in JSON payload),
    - Figuring out errors in the payload (such as unsupported fields by a specific model) if the endpoint does not explicitly return an error,
    - (The lack of) Authentication
    - (The lack of) Progress indicator
