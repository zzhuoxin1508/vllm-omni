## About

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) was originally designed to support large language models for text-based autoregressive generation tasks. vLLM-Omni is a framework that extends its support for omni-modality model inference and serving:

- **Omni-modality**: Text, image, video, and audio data processing
- **Non-autoregressive Architectures**: extend the AR support of vLLM to Diffusion Transformers (DiT) and other parallel generation models
- **Heterogeneous outputs**: from traditional text generation to multimodal outputs

vLLM-Omni is fast with:

- State-of-the-art AR support by leveraging efficient KV cache management from vLLM
- Pipelined stage execution overlapping for high throughput performance
- Fully disaggregation based on OmniConnector and dynamic resource allocation across stages

vLLM-Omni is flexible and easy to use with:

- Heterogeneous pipeline abstraction to manage complex model workflows
- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- Tensor, pipeline, data and expert parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server

vLLM-Omni seamlessly supports most popular open-source models on HuggingFace, including:

- Omni-modality models (e.g. Qwen2.5-Omni, Qwen3-Omni)
- Multi-modality generation models (e.g. Qwen-Image)
