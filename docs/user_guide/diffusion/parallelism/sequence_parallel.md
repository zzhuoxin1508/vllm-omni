## Overview

Sequence parallelism splits the input along the sequence dimension across multiple GPUs, allowing each device to process only a portion of the sequence. vLLM-Omni provides 1.5x-3.6x speedup for large images and videos using DeepSpeed Ulysses, Ring-Attention, or hybrid approaches. Use sequence parallelism when generating high-resolution images/videos that don't fit on a single GPU or require faster inference.

See supported models list in [Diffusion Features - Supported Models](../../diffusion_features.md#supported-models).

**Supported Methods:**

- **DeepSpeed Ulysses Sequence Parallel (Ulysses-SP)** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14509)): Uses all-to-all communication for subset of attention heads per device
- **Ring-Attention** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889)): Uses ring-based P2P communication with sharded sequence dimension throughout
- **Hybrid Ulysses + Ring**: Combines both for larger scale parallelism (`ulysses_degree × ring_degree`)
- **KV-Gather Context Parallel (CP)**: Keeps Q sequence-sharded and all-gathers only K/V. This is especially useful for GQA denoisers where K/V have substantially fewer heads than Q.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage - Ulysses-SP

Simplest working example with Ulysses Sequence Parallel:

```python
from vllm_omni import Omni
from vllm_omni.inputs.data import OmniDiffusionSamplingParams
from vllm_omni.diffusion.data import DiffusionParallelConfig

omni = Omni(
    model="Qwen/Qwen-Image",
    parallel_config=DiffusionParallelConfig(ulysses_degree=2)  # Enable Ulysses-SP
)

outputs = omni.generate(
    "A cat sitting on a windowsill",
    OmniDiffusionSamplingParams(num_inference_steps=50, width=1024, height=1024),
)
```

!!! note "Experimental UAA mode"
    `ulysses_mode="advanced_uaa"` is an experimental extension to Ulysses-SP. It lets Ulysses attention handle arbitrary sequence lengths and arbitrary attention head counts without relying on `attention_mask`-based token padding.

    In hybrid Ulysses + Ring mode, Ring still requires every rank in the same ring group to observe the same post-Ulysses sequence length. If that condition is not met, vLLM-Omni raises a validation error instead of entering the ring kernel with inconsistent shapes.

To enable the experimental UAA mode, use a model/configuration that requires it. For example, `Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo` has 30 attention heads, so `ulysses_degree=4` requires UAA because 30 is not divisible by 4:

```python
omni = Omni(
    model="Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo",
    parallel_config=DiffusionParallelConfig(
        ulysses_degree=4,
        ulysses_mode="advanced_uaa",
    ),
)
```

### Alternative Methods

**Ring-Attention** (better for very long sequences):

```python
omni = Omni(
    model="Qwen/Qwen-Image",
    parallel_config=DiffusionParallelConfig(ring_degree=2)  # Enable Ring-Attention
)
```

**Hybrid Ulysses + Ring** (for larger scale):

```python
omni = Omni(
    model="Qwen/Qwen-Image",
    parallel_config=DiffusionParallelConfig(ulysses_degree=2, ring_degree=2)  # 4 GPUs total
)
```

**KV-Gather Context Parallel** (BAGEL first):

```python
omni = Omni(
    model="ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT",
    parallel_config=DiffusionParallelConfig(context_parallel_degree=4),
)
```

CP trades replicated full-sequence K/V memory for lower communication volume. In
the first implementation it is mutually exclusive with Ulysses and Ring. For
parallel degree `P` and GQA head ratio `R = Hq / Hkv`, its per-rank
communication volume relative to Ulysses is `P / (R + 1)` (ignoring collective
implementation overhead). BAGEL has `R=7`, so CP4 communicates half as many
bytes as Ulysses-SP 4.

The BAGEL fast path launches asynchronous K/V All-Gathers between independent
K, V, and Q projections. The communication can be fully hidden when the V/Q
projection window covers the collective latency. Full K/V must fit on each
rank, sequence shards must be equal and unmasked, and quantized QKV projections
must expose independent projection slices to use this overlap path.

## Example Script

### Offline Inference

Use Python script under `examples/offline_inference/text_to_image/text_to_image.py`:

**Ulysses-SP:**

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/text_to_image/text_to_image.py \
    --model Qwen/Qwen-Image \
    --prompt "A cat sitting on a windowsill" \
    --ulysses-degree 2 \
    --width 1024 --height 1024
```

**Ring-Attention:**

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/text_to_image/text_to_image.py \
    --model Qwen/Qwen-Image \
    --prompt "A cat sitting on a windowsill" \
    --ring-degree 2 \
    --width 1024 --height 1024
```

**Hybrid Ulysses + Ring:**

```bash
# Hybrid: 2 Ulysses × 2 Ring = 4 GPUs total
python examples/offline_inference/text_to_image/text_to_image.py \
    --model Qwen/Qwen-Image \
    --prompt "A cat sitting on a windowsill" \
    --ulysses-degree 2 --ring-degree 2 \
    --width 1024 --height 1024
```

### Online Serving

**Ulysses-SP:**

```bash
# Text-to-image (requires >= 2 GPUs)
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen-Image --omni --port 8091 --usp 2
```

**Ulysses-SP with UAA mode** (for models with non-divisible head counts):

```bash
vllm serve Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo --omni --port 8091 --usp 4 --ulysses-mode advanced_uaa
```

**Ring-Attention:**

```bash
# Text-to-image (requires >= 2 GPUs)
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen-Image --omni --port 8091 --ring 2
```

**Hybrid Ulysses + Ring:**

```bash
# Text-to-image (requires >= 4 GPUs)
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen-Image --omni --port 8091 --usp 2 --ring 2
```

**KV-Gather Context Parallel:**

```bash
vllm serve ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT --omni --port 8091 --cp 4
```

`VLLM_OMNI_CP_DEGREE=4` supplies the CP default when neither YAML nor CLI sets
`context_parallel_degree`.

## Configuration Parameters

In `DiffusionParallelConfig`:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ulysses_degree` | int | 1 | Number of GPUs for Ulysses-SP. Uses all-to-all communication. |
| `ring_degree` | int | 1 | Number of GPUs for Ring-Attention. Uses P2P ring communication. |
| `context_parallel_degree` | int | 1 | Number of GPUs for KV-Gather CP. Q remains local; K/V are all-gathered. |
| `ulysses_mode` | str | `"default"` | Ulysses attention mode. Set to `"advanced_uaa"` to handle arbitrary sequence lengths and head counts without padding. |
| `mask_sp_padding` | bool | `False` | When the sequence length is not divisible by the SP size, tokens are auto-padded with zeros. Set to `True` to mask those padding tokens (strict, but uses the slower varlen attention path); the default `False` leaves them unmasked, keeping the fast path with negligible numerical impact. |

**Notes:**
- Total sequence parallel size is `ulysses_degree × ring_degree × context_parallel_degree`
- CP > 1 currently requires `ulysses_degree=1` and `ring_degree=1`
- Degrees must evenly divide the sequence length for optimal performance (or use `ulysses_mode="advanced_uaa"` for Ulysses-SP)
- `mask_sp_padding` is an experimental feature, currently only supported by `Wan2.2`, `Wan2.2 Vace`, `Qwen-Image`, `Flux 2`, and `HunyuanVideo 1.5`


## Best Practices

### When to Use

**Good for:**

- Large images (1024x1024 or higher) or videos
- Fast inter-GPU communication, larger bandwidth (e.g., NVLink)

**Not for:**

- Small images (<1024px) - overhead exceeds benefit, use single GPU with cache instead

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue 1: Performance Not Scaling

**Symptoms**: Adding GPUs doesn't improve speed proportionally, or higher parallelism degree is slower

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check GPU topology
nvidia-smi topo -m

```

**Solutions:**

1. Check inter-GPU communication - NVLink is better than PCIe
2. Reduce parallelism degree if over-parallelized:
```python
# If 4 GPUs is slower than 2
parallel_config=DiffusionParallelConfig(ulysses_degree=2)
```
3. Try to switch between Ring-Attention and Ulysses-SP

- Ring-Attention has advantages, like communication-computation overlap, but the block-wise loop overhead is relatively higher, especially for short sequences
- Ulysses-SP: can benefit from larger bandwidth (such as NVLink), with two major constraints, the sequence length should be divisible by usp size, and the number of heads should be divisible by usp size (or use `ulysses_mode="advanced_uaa"`)


### Common Issue 2: Out of Memory (OOM)

**Symptoms**: CUDA OOM errors or process crashes with memory errors

**Solutions:**

1. Increase parallelism degree to split sequence more:
```python
parallel_config=DiffusionParallelConfig(ulysses_degree=4)  # From 2
```
2. Combine with other parallelism method, e.g., tensor parallel, and memory optimization methods, e.g., cpu offloading.


## Summary

1. ✅ **Enable Sequence Parallelism** - Set `ulysses_degree` or `ring_degree` for long sequence generation
2. ✅ **UAA mode** - Use `ulysses_mode="advanced_uaa"` when head count is not divisible by `ulysses_degree`
3. ✅ **Troubleshooting** - Check GPU topology with `nvidia-smi topo -m`, reduce degree if performance doesn't scale
