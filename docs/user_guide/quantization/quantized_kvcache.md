# Quantized KV Cache

## Overview

In DiT-based image and video generation, Flash Attention can take a large share
of denoising time, especially for high-resolution or long-frame workloads.
vLLM-Omni supports online FP8 quantization for eligible diffusion Flash
Attention (FA) to reduce FA latency while keeping model weights in their
original dtype.

This feature is configured through `kv_cache_dtype`, matching the option name
used by vLLM's language-model KV-cache quantization. In vLLM-Omni diffusion
pipelines, however, it is a runtime FA path: Q/K/V tensors are dynamically
quantized before the attention operator. It does not quantize model weights and
is separate from [FP8 W8A8](fp8.md), [Int8 W8A8](int8.md), or pre-quantized
checkpoint formats.

If `kv_cache_dtype` is not set, behavior is unchanged and attention runs in the
native dtype.

## Hardware Support

| Device | FP8 FA |
|--------|--------|
| Ascend NPU | ✅ |
| NVIDIA GPU | ❌ |
| AMD ROCm | ❌ |
| Intel XPU | ❌ |

Legend: `✅` supported, `❌` unsupported.

FP8 FA is currently implemented only for the NPU Flash Attention backend. Other
backends do not support `kv_cache_dtype="fp8"` for diffusion attention and fall
back to native dtype execution.

## Model Type Support

### Diffusion Model

| Model | Scope | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Wan2.2 | Eligible DiT full-attention FA on Ascend NPU | Tested | Compare quality and latency against a BF16 baseline before production use |
| Other diffusion models | Eligible DiT full-attention FA on Ascend NPU | Not tested | You can try `kv_cache_dtype="fp8"`; tune `kv_cache_skip_steps` and `kv_cache_skip_layers` when higher precision is needed |

### Multi-Stage Omni/TTS Model (Qwen3-Omni, Qwen3-TTS)

Not tested for FP8 FA. Treat any use as experimental unless a model-specific
guide documents support.

### Multi-Stage Diffusion Model (BAGEL, GLM-Image)

Not tested. If the diffusion stage uses the same NPU Flash Attention backend,
`kv_cache_dtype` may apply in theory; validate quality and latency for each
stage and model.

## Configuration

Offline diffusion example:

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/image_to_video/image_to_video.py \
    --model <your-wan2.2-model> \
    --prompt "A cat sitting on a surfboard at the beach" \
    --height 1280 \
    --width 720 \
    --num-frames 61 \
    --num-inference-steps 4 \
    --ulysses-degree 4 \
    --vae-patch-parallel-size 4 \
    --kv-cache-dtype fp8 \
    --kv-cache-skip-steps "0,1" \
    --kv-cache-skip-layers "0-2"
```

Online serving:

```bash
vllm serve <your-model> --omni --kv-cache-dtype fp8
```

Stage config:

```yaml
stage_args:
  - stage_id: 0
    stage_type: diffusion
    engine_args:
      model_stage: dit
      kv_cache_dtype: "fp8"
      kv_cache_skip_steps: "0,1"
      kv_cache_skip_layers: "0-2"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `kv_cache_dtype` | str \| None | `None` | Set to `"fp8"` to enable dynamic FP8 FA on supported attention backends |
| `kv_cache_skip_steps` | str \| None | `None` | Denoising step selector to keep in native dtype, for example `"0,1,4-6"` |
| `kv_cache_skip_layers` | str \| None | `None` | Transformer layer selector to keep in native dtype, for example `"0-2,10"` |

Selectors use comma-separated integers and inclusive ranges. Listed steps or
layers skip FP8 FA; all other eligible full-attention forwards use the FP8 path.

## Validation and Notes

1. Compare generated images or videos against a BF16 baseline with the same
   seed, prompt, resolution, frame count, and denoising steps.
2. Use `kv_cache_skip_steps` for denoising steps where quality is more
   sensitive.
3. Use `kv_cache_skip_layers` for transformer layers that show visible quality
   regressions.
4. Report both latency and quality results when enabling this option for a new
   model. For image or video models, include visual comparison and quantitative
   metrics when available, such as PSNR or SSIM.
