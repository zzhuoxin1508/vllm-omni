# List of files (relative to repo root) that are allowed to import pickle or
# cloudpickle
#
# STOP AND READ BEFORE YOU ADD ANYTHING ELSE TO THIS LIST:
#  The pickle and cloudpickle modules are known to be unsafe when deserializing
#  data from potentially untrusted parties. They have resulted in multiple CVEs
#  for vLLM and numerous vulnerabilities in the Python ecosystem more broadly.
#  Before adding new uses of pickle/cloudpickle, please consider safer
#  alternatives like msgpack or pydantic that are already in use in vLLM. Only
#  add to this list if absolutely necessary and after careful security review.
