# Community Recipes

This directory contains community-maintained recipes for answering a
practical user question:

> How do I run model X on hardware Y for task Z?

Add recipes for this repository under this in-repo `recipes/` directory. To
keep naming and layout consistent, organize recipes by model vendor in a way
that is aligned with
[`vllm-project/recipes`](https://github.com/vllm-project/recipes), but treat
that external repository as a reference for structure rather than the place to
add files for this repo. Use one Markdown file per model family by default.

Example layout:

```text
recipes/
  Qwen/
    Qwen3-Omni.md
    Qwen3-TTS.md
  Tencent-Hunyuan/
    HunyuanVideo.md
```
